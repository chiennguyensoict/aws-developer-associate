# Elastic Beanstalk (EB)

Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service environment which can create and manage infrastructure for application code.

- User provides code and EB handles the environment
- It also support customization to control how you want the infrastructure
- Any custom defination about the infrastructure can be committed along with the source code

CloudFormation instead is Infrastructure as Code.

- It provides full control over the infrastructure
- But you have to design it, write it and manage it

---

## EB Platforms

- EB supports a list of languages natively
- Docker allows to use any unsupported runtime
- Supports custom platforms

Docker can have

- single containers
- multiple containers if your application uses multiple containers

> Multiple containers are orchestrated using ECS

Preconfigured docker

- These have platforms that are not yet natively supported

Custom platforms can be created using packer

## Architecture

Application Versions

- These are specific labelled version of deployable code for an application
- The source bundle is stored on S3

Environments are containers of infrastructure and configuration for a specific application version

- Here: PROCESSING, PROD, TEST

Each environment is either

- Web server tier
- Worker tier

### Flow

Both environment web and worker tier has Auto Scaling Groups within them.

- Web server tier accept connections from customers via ELB
- Any work load generated by Web server tier can then be passed into a SQS queue as messages
- The Worker tier receives the messages from the SQS queue

### Scaling

Web Server Tier scales based on the number of request to the ELB.

Worker Tier scales based on the number of messages in the SQS queue.

### CNAME

Each environment has its own CNAME.

User can connect to our application using the CNAME or the DNS name.

- CNAME allows swapping two environment DNS
- This swapping is called `blue-green` deployment

## Considerations

- It needs application tweaks
- Use docker for anything unsupported
- Great for small development teams
- Databases are generally OUTSIDE of elastic beanstalk
- Databases within the environment are deleted, when environment is deleted
