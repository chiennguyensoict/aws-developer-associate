### AWS::CloudFormation::Init

**cfn-init** is a helper script installed on EC2 OS.

This is a simple configuration management system.

Procedural (user Data) vs Desired State (cfn-init)

Packages, groups, users, sources, files, commands, services, and ownerships.

This is executed as any other command by passing into the instance with
the user-data.

This is provided with directives via Metadata and AWS::CloudFormation::Init on
a CFN resource

#### cfn-init explained

Starts off with a **cloud formation template**
This has a logical resource within it which is to create an EC2 instance.

This has a specific section called `Metadata:`

This then passes in the information passed in as `UserData`

cfn-init gets variables passed into the userdata by cloud formation

It knows the desired state desired by the user and can work towards a
final stated configuration

This can monitor the userdata and change things as the EC2 data changes.

#### CreationPolicy and Signals

The template has a specific part designated signals

A creation policy is added to a logical resource. It is provided a
timeout value. The resource itself will trigger a signal that cloud formation
can continue

# VPC Peering

Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network.

The VPCs can be in different regions (also known as an inter-region VPC peering connection).

This is neither a gateway nor a VPN connection, and does not rely on a separate piece of physical hardware.

## use case

A VPC peering connection helps you to facilitate the transfer of data. For example, if you have more than one AWS account, you can peer the VPCs across those accounts to create a file sharing network. You can also use a VPC peering connection to allow other VPCs to access resources you have in one of your VPCs.

- In case of cross account peering connection, one account creates the peering connection request and other approves the same

# VPC

Can a VPC span across regions?
